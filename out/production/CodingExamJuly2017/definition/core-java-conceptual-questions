What is IDE?
Ans : Ide is An Integrated Development Environment.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans:Java life cycle is  According to sun, there is only 4 states in thread life cycle in java new,
runnable, non-runnable and terminated. There is no running state. But for better understanding the threads,
we are explaining it in the 5 states. The life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM.

what is class?
Ans: Class is a blue print of an object.

What is object?
Ans: Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: Main methods is the entry point of an application in java.

Why main is static?
Ans:Because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class. Similarly,
we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects.
void indicates that the main() method being declared does not return a value.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans:Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.
and Variables declared in a Java interface is by default fina.A Java abstract class can have instance methods
that implements default behavior.and abstract class may contain non-final variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

what is Access Specifier?
Ans:The access to classes, constructors, methods and fields are regulated using access modifiers
a class can control what information or data can be accessible by other classes. A member has package or
default accessibility when no accessibility modifier is specified.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: OOP is a Object Oriented Programming.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans:Java application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the
Java development kit (JDK). It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with
their methods, fields, and constructors. These prewritten classes provide a tremendous amount of
functionality to a programmer.

Does java support multiple inheritance?
Ans: No

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans:Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name,
if their argument lists are different.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans:The term exception is shorthand for the phrase "exceptional event." Definition: An exception is an event,
which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans:The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that
class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans: Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited,
final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans: Final: Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited,
     final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
     Finally: Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
     finalize: Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
Ans: Constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans:In Java this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
It can be used to refer current class instance variable.

What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans:It is used inside a sub class method definition to call a method defined in the super class.
Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: JVM Stand is Java virtual machine.

What version of java are you using?
Ans: jdk1.8.0_141

What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: JAR stand for Java ARchive.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans:A compiled program can be opened and run by a user.The terms runtime and compile time are
often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors. A compile time error is a problem
such as a syntax error or missing file reference that prevents the program from successfully compiling.

What is heap?
Ans:The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Ans:Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may
increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Ans:
What is Singleton class?
Ans: A singleton class is a class that can have only one object an instance of the class at a time.
To design a singleton class.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Ans:Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a
disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes
is called deserialization

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

Why is String Immutable in Java?
What is constructor chaining in Java?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
What is JIT stands for?
Ans: Just In Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Ans:During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new
objects. Note that the JVM uses more memory than just the heap. For example Java methods, thread stacks and
native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap, as well as JVM internal data structures

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Ans: The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local
 variables and function call while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
