Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans:Create the data structure once, and it can be used again and again easily.It is the same intuitions that led
to the rise of data structures and algorithms to arrange and process the data in the memory for efficient storage, access
and processing.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?

what is an Array?
Ans:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans:First and Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed length data structure

what is LinkedList?
Ans:A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element we will call it a node
of a list is comprising of two items the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
what is queue?
Ans: Queue Interface In Java. The java.util.Queue is a subtype of java.util.Collection interface.

what is stack?
Ans: Java provides an inbuilt object type called Stack. It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: FIFO and LIFO are cost layering methods used to value the cost of goods sold and ending inventory.

what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?

what is tree in data structure?
Ans:In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type or data structure implementing that simulates a
hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
Ans:  A Graph data structure consists of a finite and possibly mutable set of vertices or nodes or points.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: HashTable doesn't allow null key value and it is syncronized.
     HashMap allows null key value and it is not syncronized.


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans:In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location.
In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: DFS is depth first search and BFS is breadth first search are the two algorithms used for traversing
and searching a node in a graph.

What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is a basic programming technique its can use in Java, in which a method calls it self to solve some problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans:Linear data structures are in which all the data are arranged in sequence manner and  Non linear data structure are
in which all the data are arranged in random manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
